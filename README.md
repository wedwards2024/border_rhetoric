# Politics and Policy: Border Rhetoric on the U.S. House Floor, 2018 - 2022

## Abstract: This project analyzes rhetoric regarding the U.S.-Mexico border that happened among U.S. congressional representatives from 2018 - 2022. Over those two sessions of Congress, the 116th and 117th, representatives responded to significant policy changes on the ground and also to a Republican-to-Democrat power tilt in Washington. By using python to analyze transcripts that discussed the border from the Library of Congress, my project explores how rhetoric shifted while these changes occured, particularly focusing on the rhetoric of the weaker party in both sessions. I web scraped the transcripts for both sessions from the Library Digital Archive. The text analysis tools I implemented to investigate this topic leaned heavily on nltk and also on WordClouds. As the sessions turned, criticisms of border policies remained prevalent, but the subjects of these criticisms changed. In the 116th Congress, rhetoric extolling humanitarian values and sympathy for migrants was salient; in the 117th, the dominant topics became the safety and wellbeing of U.S. citizens. This project is not expansive enough draw a specific link between these two perspectives and the two main parties in Washington. However, it does offer insight into how representatives balanced policy at the border and the politics of Washington in their rhetoric.
